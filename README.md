Final project for Database Management - a MySQL data generator

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE understand... I was not able to spend the amount of time (especially in the design phase) 
as I would have liked to for this project. There are terrible global variables, inefficient code, inconsistent
processes across different files, and an insulting lack of tests. However, it works. Therefore, I rest my case 
and you have been warned. 

If you didn't read this file, your brain may be scrambled in the process of understanding why I did what I did.

Error notice: if you are trying to run this yourself, there is an error in the library that generates random city
names... I did not have the time to try and figure out what caused it or how to rectify it. It only happens 
sometimes and throws `KeyError: 'city'`... if this happens to you, just rerun it until it works. High-level stuff,
I know.
